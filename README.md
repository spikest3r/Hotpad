## How to use?

Hotkeys work only when **NumLock is OFF**.

- Press Slash on numpad to toggle between action keys (Home, Page Up etc.) and hotkeys mapped in Hotpad.

- Press Asterisk to open settings.

- Press 1 - 9 to invoke hotkey

## What hotkey mappings are possible?

Right now you can open file (it can be any file or app, but always specify full path) or URL, auto input text and press key combinations like CTRL+C or CTRL+SHIFT+D.

## More features in future

In future I plan to add more features like:

- In auto input ability to use F1-F12, Tab, Delete and Insert aside from just letter/number.

- File dialog to make selecting file/executable easier.

- Add 0 button as possible hotkey.

- Add layers so you can have different hotkeys for different situations. (Planned to switch layers with Numpad Dot key).
